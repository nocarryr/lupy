NAMING CONVENTION
- The file names refer to the signals mentioned in above two specifications.
- The bitdepth is indicated at the end of each filename.
- Please note there are two versions of seq-3341-6:
-- seq-3341-6-5channels-16bit.wav is the original 5.0 version (channel order: L, R, C, LS, RS), but uses the WAVE_FORMAT_PCM flag.
-- seq-3341-6-6channels-WAVEEX-16bit.wav is the same as above, but with a silent .1 channel and using the WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE flag.
- Files seq-3341-3..., seq-3341-4..., and seq-3341-5... differ from v01 of this test set. They were first described in the August 2011 publication of EBU Tech 3341 and to prevent confusion, they are labeled 'v02'.
- File seq-3341-8_seq-3342-6... also differs from the v01 version - It was first described in the August 2011 publication of EBU Tech 3341 and EBU tech 3342 and to prevent confusion, it is also labeled 'v02'. It also has '2011' in its name.
